      <p>
        MedicNucleus started out as a small scale pharmaceutical venture in
        1958. It was a partnership effort of four young and enterprising men
        whose determination and passion saw it through the turmoil of the
        incipient period. By its fourth year, Square turned into a profit making
        organization.
