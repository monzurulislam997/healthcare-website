            <h4>The cycle of poverty is an interconnected mix of factors that imprisons entire communities for generations. While it’s difficult to unwind every element of poverty, one thing stands out — health conditions and access to health care play a huge factor in a community’s poverty rate. Children in impoverished communities live without access to basic health necessities such as clean water and sanitation, ushering in preventable diseases or worse. Health issues often cause children to fall behind in school, and a lack of education leads the way for drug use, early pregnancy and gang affiliation..</h4>
